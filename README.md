&nbsp;This Software allows you to rename music files according to a rule or pattern set by its "Tags". This rule can be set by the user.

For example: I have an audio file with the name `AUD-01230101-WA0123.mp3` but it has tags, so I can decide to call it according to the following order: `TrackNumber-Title-Artist.mp3`.

## How to use:

***

## Required:
- Windows 7 or higher (Recommended Windows 10/11) x86/x64.
- .NET SDK 6 (LTS) to compile and run.
- .NET Desktop Runtime 6 to run.

***

## Dependencies:
### Frameworks
- Microsoft.NETCore.App **(6.0.x)**.
- Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App.WPF **(6.0.x)**

### Packages
- Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Design **(7.0.3)**

## Languajes
For adding/modifying languages I highly recommend the **extension** for **Visual Studio 2022** called `ResX Manager`. It makes it much easier to manage multiple languages.
The language `.resx` files are saved in the `.\RenameMusic\Lang\` folder.

***

## Compile:
Compile via **Visual Studio 2022**. The other way is to run the `dotnet build` command from terminal (cmd/powershell) in the root of the repository and then check inside of the `\RenameMusic\bin\` folder.
